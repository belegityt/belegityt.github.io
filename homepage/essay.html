    A Walk in the Park
  </h2>

  <p id="p">
    Every morning and every night, every day of every week, rain or shine, hot or cold, I take a walk in the park. I didn’t always do this, I only started around three years ago when we adopted a dog and I was given the task of taking her on daily walks. I remember going to the park before we adopted the dog, I remember playing on the swing sets, running across the meadow, and hiding behind trees. The park certainly felt massive then, in a very comforting way. When I was in the park, I felt free. When I would run across the meadow with my friends, I’d feel like I could run forever, even if my little legs disagreed. It felt like I was in control of what happened there; I decided where and how I would play.
  </p>
  <p id="p">
    That feeling never left the park. When I first started taking the dog there, I never took notice of how the same people would show up day after day. After a month or so, I started recognizing the dogs, learning their names, seeing how they interacted with me and my dog. I noticed she was making some close friends, she would see them arrive from the other side of the park and immediately bolt over to them, her tail wagging freely all the way. I took delight in seeing her run through the same meadow and hide behind the same trees as I did all those years ago. I also took comfort in the familiarity of it all. Every day, the park would look the same. The same people would be there, my dog would play with the same friends, and we would walk down the same paths together. No matter what was going on in the real world, the park was there, in its own solitary space. No matter how I was feeling, the park always cheered me up and comforted me in the same way.
  </p>
  <p id="p">
    Of course, as with anything, the park had to change. Over time, some people stopped coming, others joined in, the meadow bloomed and withered, the paint on the swing sets chipped away, and the steel it revealed rusted over. When I first started noticing the changes, I couldn’t stop thinking about them. I would spend hours over the following weeks reflecting on my experiences at the park, what they had meant to me, how I had come to rely on the park and the solace it brought me. I would think in mournful silence as I walked along the familiar paths, no longer finding brilliance in the natural, vibrant way that they twisted and turned through the meadow.

    Once the air of solemnity cleared, I discovered a different park than my clouded vision had shown me. While the trees had begun to bow their branches and shed their leaves, new leaves had begun growing in their place. Likewise, as some of the old regulars began to move on to pastures new, the next generation had come in without me realizing it. Few of the close friends ever left; it was mainly the familiar faces that sat in the background which moved on. As the old guard thinned, new friends came in to fill in the cracks. There was a real community, a community which interacted with one another and helped one another. Instead of two owners trading small talk while watching their pets play, the owners gather in an area of the meadow while the dogs are given free reign to play wherever they please.

    It’s not easy to affect change as a teenager. Teenagers have to speak up at ten times the volume to make half the impact an adult makes. I live in that world. I’ve lived in that world since I started taking my dog to the park. Just as it was when I was a little child, the park is a place that defies all logic, or at least all the norms we set as a society to get through our day. In the park, I can make that change, I can build a community, I can help improve the places I love. Even now, I feel as though I’m in control of what happens in the park. I decide where and how I play. I decide it every morning and every night. I decide it every day of every week. I decide it, rain or shine. I decide it, hot or cold. I decide it because I take a walk in the park.
