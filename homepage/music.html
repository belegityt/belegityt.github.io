      Here are some of my demos and drafts!
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a tune called <u>Porch Swingin'</u>, which I wrote on Mother's Day 2020. My family's gift for my mother was a porch swing, which she had wanted for a very long time. I wrote the song in an hour on the swing and revised it slightly a few days later.

      This is a tune I wrote in mid-late June of 2020 called <u>Trapped in the Past</u>. It originally had three verses but I decided it was better off as a shorter tune.

    <p>This tune, called <u>Survival</u>, is an adaptation of a poem of the same name by Rona Munro. I only ever recorded this one once, a few days after writing it. I was never fully satisfied with my adaptation of Munro's vision.</p>
    <p id="caption">This demo was recorded on June 25, 2020.</p>

    <p>This tune, <u>Visions in the Smoke</u>, was originally written on January 6, 2021, while I was watching the news coverage of the insurrection on the United States Capitol. It is still in progress as of March 2021. It was originally called "What They Want to See".</p>

    <p>This tune is called <u>Garden of our Own</u>, and is still in the very early days of writing. I was inspired by a drama called "The Day of Darkness" by John Lucarotti. I started writing it as a break between revisions of Visions in the Smoke.</p>
    <p id="caption">This is the first and currently only draft, recorded on Jan 28, 2021.</p>
